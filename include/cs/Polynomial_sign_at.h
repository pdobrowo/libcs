 * New algorithm for polynomial interval sign determination

 * It is faster than the algorithm proposed by Hemmer et. al.
 * The idea is to assume that the plynomial is locally mototonic.
 * By using polynomial sign at point, and polynomial differential it is possible
 * to deduce what the sign of whole interval is.
